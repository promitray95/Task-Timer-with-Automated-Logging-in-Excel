This project is a VBA-powered Excel tool designed to streamline task tracking. 
It features a simple interface with Start Timer and Stop Timer buttons, allowing users to record task durations effortlessly. 
Start and stop times, along with the processing duration, are automatically logged into a separate worksheet (LogSheet). 
The log sheet includes additional fields for manual data entry, such as Date, Sample_Case_Number, and Type_of_Complaint. 
The tool perfectly tracks time spent on tasks and efficiently manages time-sensitive processes.
